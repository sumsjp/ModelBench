Okay, here's a thorough transcription of the provided text, focusing on organization, clarity, and identifying key takeaways/subjects:

**OVERVIEW**

This dialogue is a podcast/interview format with two individuals:

*   **Host (Interviewer):** Enthusiastically supports and promotes the work of a guest/organization focused on improving school nutrition and student health. Very encouraging and emphasizes the unique value of their program.
*   **Guest:** A proponent of nutrition-based solutions to common childhood ailments, and head of a school lunch/training program.  She’s been practicing this system for 30 years, and highlights the disconnection between diet, diagnosis, and mental/physical health.

**FULL TRANSACTION**

**(Introduction/Show Open – Host expresses excitement about the guest and program)**

**Host:** "…I'm really excited to get this message out to your followers, and any support is just greatly appreciated. I really believe like you said, now is the time and we can't wait.  It's just, it’s time, our children need us.”

**Guest:** "Awesome, Thank you very much.”

**(Guest Explaining Core Philosophy / Program)**

**Guest:** “I think the other thing that we're doing that is a disservice to our children is that these diagnoses, you know, are kind of just their lot in life, and there's nothing *you* can do about it. You’re just going to *be* on medication. You know… my child with eczema, I was like… oh... I'll probably have asthma, eczema, allergies that just *run* hand-in-hand. He might outgrow it. He might not. Put him on raw milk and cod liver oil, and he’s *completely* healed, you know. And I was just like… what? Food *just* healed my child. Like... you know? So… it’s understanding the power of food *and* the power in the agency that *we* have and so… getting to that root cause is so important and so much of it does lie in what we’re putting into our bodies."

**Host:** "I've spotted this as something that’s super super important, and I looked a lot of different programs like I didn’t find anything that comes even close to what you guys do, and then, to find out you have a training program... I’m like I’m going to get behind that."

**Guest:** "The training academy, they’re lifechanging. I’m literally, like, 100% money back guarantee if your life hasn’t changed forever. It just… and you just get it! So… I'm really excited to get this message out to your followers and thank you so much for sharing our message. Any support is just greatly appreciated."

**(Guest Deep dives into program philosophy and how it works)**

**Guest:** "I think the other thing that we're doing that is a disservice to our children is that these diagnoses are kind of just their lot in life and there’s nothing you can do about it. You’re just going to *be* on medication. You know… my child with eczema, I was like… oh... I'll probably have asthma, eczema, allergies that just *run* hand-in-hand. He might outgrow it. He might not. Put him on raw milk and cod liver oil, and he’s *completely* healed, you know. And I was just like… what? Food *just* healed my child. Like... you know? So… it’s understanding the power of food *and* the power in the agency that *we* have and so… getting to that root cause is so important and so much of it does lie in what we’re putting into our bodies."

**Host:** "I’ve spotted this as something that’s super super important, and I looked at a lot of different programs like I didn’t find anything that comes even close to what you guys do, and then, to find out you have a training program I’m like I’m going to get behind that. It's amazing, I think what you're doing is amazing and it's just… wow, There's. I looked at a lot of different things out there. I didn't find anything that comes even close to what you guys do."

**Guest:** “I've been practice it for 30 years and so the first question I ask every single person coming in - kids and adults - is, you come in with a problem, *what are you eating?* What are you eating? We don’t ask that, but I don't think people appreciate the connection between what you’re eating and these diagnoses. As ADD, attention deficit disorder like all these mental/physical illnesses. The things that we're just labeling... instead of actually looking at the root cause. To fix it, let food be your medicine."

**Host**: "It's just so important. Thank you so much for everything you do. And for the followers who are listening. We'll put links in the show notes on how to learn more, how to donate, and how to join the training academy if that's part of your journey.”

**(Closing/Call to Action)**

**Host**: "…I’m so grateful. I want to thank you for giving up a space and telling us about your work and I’m really excited to get this message out to our followers and any support, that’s just greatly appreciated. I really believe, like you said, now’s the time, and we can’t wait, it’s just time, our children need us.

**Guest:** "Awesome, Thank you very much."
